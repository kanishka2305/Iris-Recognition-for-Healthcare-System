# Iris-Recognition-for-Healthcare-System

## INTRODUCTION :

The "Iris Recognition for Healthcare System" project seeks to create a biometric solution for the healthcare sector that emphasizes the application of iris recognition technology for improved patient identification and data security. Traditional methods, like ID cards and passwords, are vulnerable to mistakes, theft, and forgery, which can result in serious risks like incorrect identification, medical mistakes, and disregards of sensitive personal health information. Iris recognition is a highly accurate and secure way to identify people due to the distinct patterns in the human iris that are stable all throughout life and different even between twins with identical features that are unique.By utilizing these features, this project tackles important healthcare issues by providing a non-invasive, dependable, and effective method of connecting patients with their medical records and guaranteeing that highly confidential data is only accessible by those who are allowed. 

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT :

The scope of a project on iris recognition for healthcare systems involves developing a secure, efficient, and accurate biometric identification system tailored to the unique needs of healthcare environments. This system would aim to enhance patient privacy, streamline access control to sensitive medical records, and ensure that only authorized personnel can access critical healthcare facilities. Through advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms, iris recognition can provide high accuracy for patient identification, mitigating risks associated with traditional ID methods such as cards or PINs, which can be lost, stolen, or misused​

## EXISTING SYSTEM :

Existing systems for iris recognition in healthcare focus primarily on secure identification and access control for both patients and medical staff, as healthcare organizations strive to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access. These systems are based on biometric authentication, leveraging the unique patterns in the human iris for reliable and non-invasive identification. Traditional healthcare security measures, such as access cards or passwords, can be easily compromised or forgotten, while iris recognition provides a highly secure alternative due to its low false acceptance and rejection rates

## PROPOSED SYSTEM :

The proposed system for iris recognition in healthcare aims to implement a highly secure, accurate, and multifaceted biometric system that not only supports patient and staff identification but also explores potential diagnostic applications. This system will use advanced deep learning models and improved image processing techniques to overcome challenges such as varying lighting conditions, partial occlusions, and demographic diversity in patient populations. By utilizing neural network architectures like CNNs or transfer learning models (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet), the system can improve iris segmentation, pattern matching, and identification accuracy, even in challenging environments​
